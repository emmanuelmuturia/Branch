## 1) Background
- This project is an implementation of the Take Home Assignment offered by Branch International...
- It utilises [The Branch API](https://android-messaging.branch.co/) which has the following endpoints:

### a) /api/messages
- This endpoint allows the user to fetch customer messages using a GET request...
- It also allows for the addition of a message as an agent using a POST message...

### b) /api/login
- This is the authentication endpoint that provides an authentication token if the username and password provided match the configured criteria...

### c) /api/reset
- To reset the customer messages to their original state, this endpoint can be called using a POST request...

## 2) Architecture
- Branch is a multi-module Android app implemented using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Architectural Pattern...
- It is divided into the following modules:

### a) :app
- This is the main module that houses MainActivity and BranchApplication...
- MainActivity acts as the entry-point of the app following the Dependency Injection implementation while BranchApplication initialises the app and any other required dependencies...

### b) :authentication
- This module contains the Login Screen and its ViewModel...
- It provides the Login functionality by making an API call using the POST method to retrieve an authentication token from the REST API server...

### c) :commons
- It contains all of the shared resources within the app such as shared UI components, state screens, and the theming materials...

### d) :messages
- This module houses both the Messages Screen and the Conversation Screen as well as their ViewModels...
- They both implement the Repository pattern to perform a GET request in order to retrieve customer messages from the remote server...

### e) :navigation
- This module has both the NavGraph and Routes implementations which allow for navigation between different screens using [Compose Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation)...

### f) :network
- This is the core module of the app that contains all of the network-related implementations...
- It provides all the configurations and resources needed to make successful API calls using Retrofit2, OkHTTP3, and Kotlin Serialization...

### g) :settings
- This is an auxiliary module that contains the About Screen and its ViewModels...
- It provides the app's information as well as the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy for Branch International...

## 3) Testing
- Branch has been tested based on the following categories:

### a) Unit Tests
- The Unit Tests were written using MockK and Robolectric:

![The Unit Tests](https://github.com/emmanuelmuturia/Branch/assets/55001497/a2433afd-2e9f-4f45-b97e-5ccbac38e0b8)


### b) UI Tests
- The UI Tests have been performed using a Robo Test by Firebase Test Lab:

### c) Security Tests
- The Security Tests were conducted using Snyk:

## 4) Credits
- Branch has been built using the following Tools, Technologies, and Libraries:

### a) Jetpack Compose
- The app has utilised Google's modern UI toolkit ([Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)) for its User Interface that prioritises the Kotlin-first approach of Android App Development (AAD)...

### b) Dagger-Hilt
- To provide dependencies in an easy and modular fashion, [Dagger-Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) has been used in conjunction with:

### c) Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP)
- For faster builds regarding Annotations, [KSP](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-overview.html) has been implemented as a plugin...

### d) Retrofit2
- As a core library, [Retrofit2](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) has been utilised for performing remote calls to the REST API through a level of abstraction...

### e) OkHTTP3
- In addition to Retrofit2, [OkHTTP3](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) has also been implemented to aid in configuring the remote calls by providing an Interceptor and specifying the expected data type as JSON...

### f) Kotlin Serialization
- During the remote calls, the returned data has been serialized and deserialized using the [Kotlin Serialization Plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/serialization.html)...

### g) Splash Screen
- The app has implemented its Splash Screen using Google's [Splash Screen API](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen) which uses its custom theme alongside the app's theme...

### h) LeakCanary
- To detect and fix memory leaks, [LeakCanary](https://square.github.io/leakcanary/) has been implemented...

### i) MockK, Kotlin Coroutines Test, and Robolectric
- During testing [MockK](https://mockk.io/) has been used to mimic the dependencies to be tested resulting in a close-to-real test case scenario...
- In addition to MockK, [Robolectric](https://robolectric.org/) has been utilised to provide a simulated Android environment to run test cases that rely on Android-specific dependencies...
- The Unit Tests used the [Kotlin Coroutines Test](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-test/) library to provide the Coroutine Scopes for the suspending functions that were being tested...

### j) Firebase
- Branch has incorporated [Firebase Performance](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/get-started-android) and [Firebase Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/get-started?platform=android) for conducting app analysis as well as [Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/get-started) for UI Testing...

## 5) Trivia
- Branch has used a hybrid modularisation technique where each of the modules listed above has implemented sub-modules that match the Presentation, Domain, and Data Layers in Android...

## 6) Future
- Branch has been fully built and no future developments are in place...
